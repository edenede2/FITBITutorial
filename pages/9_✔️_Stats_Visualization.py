    In this plot, we can see in the y-axis the size of each gap (in minutes) that was found in the 1 minute resolution file of the selected subjects. The x-axis shows the number of gaps with that size.

    By looking at this plot, we can understand the distribution of the gaps in the heart rate data for the selected subjects. We can see if there are any patterns in the gaps, such as a high number of gaps with a specific size.

    For example, if we see a high number of gaps with small size of 1 to 2 minute, it may be normal, but if its a very high number of gaps with that size, it may be an indication that there are a problem with the way the data was collected or processed.

    On the other hand, if we see a high number of gaps with a very large size, it may be an indication that there are long periods of missing data in the heart rate data or that the subject was not wearing the device for a long time.

We can see if there are any patterns in the missing data, such as a high percentage of missing data for specific days or a low percentage of missing data for a sequence of days as some kind of baseline.

    For example, if we see a high percentage of missing data for a sequence of days, it may be an indication that the subject was not wearing the device for that period or that there are problems with the data collection or processing.

    On the other hand, if we see a persistent low to medium percentage of missing data for all the days, it may be an indication that there are some problems with the data collection or processing that need to be addressed by looking at the raw data or the processing steps.

    The mean percentage of missing data for all the days is shown as a horizontal line in the plot. This line can help us to understand the overall behavior of the missing data for the selected subjects.
