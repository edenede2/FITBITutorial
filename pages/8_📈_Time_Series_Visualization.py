After producing the final 1-minute resolution file, it is recommended to visually inspect the data. Here we provide convenient tools to visualize and examine the time series data.  The main goal is to detect unusual patterns and consider whether this subject should be included in the analysis. Also, it can also be used for examining some of the assumptions that were made in the previous steps. 


Taking the time to go over the time series data is an important part of quality check. 

Generally, it is recommended to start the visual inspection using the following questions as guidelines: 

1.	Does the length of the data is as expected? Do you have enough available days for your study goal? 

2.	Are there any obvious periods of noticeable missing data? 

3.	Does the signal look roughly ok? (i.e. can we detect periods of sleep? 

4.	Is there an unusual pattern of data? e.g. complete days with zero steps, heart rate data looks too noisy, sleep data is really fragmented? 

5.	Any other irregularities

    The 'Time Series Visualization' page in our app is where we visualize the time series data from the 1 minute resolution file of all the subjects in the project.

    The time series data should help us to understand the behavior of the signals over time for each subject with different filters from the 1 minute resolution file.

    The time series plots should help us to identify any patterns or anomalies in the data that we can use to further analyze the data.

    The time series plots include the following:

    1. StepsInMinute: The number of steps taken by the subject in each minute.

    2. BpmMean: The mean heart rate of the subject in each minute of the experiment (without the missing values).

    3. Sleeping: A binary variable that indicates whether the subject is sleeping or not in each minute of the experiment.

    4. Sleep Stages: The sleep stages of the subject in each minute of the experiment.

    5. Feature: The visualization of the 'Feature' column in the 1 minute resolution file. It shows the categorical values of the 'Feature' column in the data for each minute.

    6. ValidSleep: A binary variable that indicates whether the subject is in a valid sleep or not in each minute of the experiment.

    7. Weekend: A binary variable that indicates whether the day is a weekend or not in each minute of the experiment.

    8. Outliers: A binary variable that indicates whether the bpm value in the specific minute is identified as an outlier or not for the specific feature.

    9. Not in IL: A binary variable that indicates whether the subject is in Israel at the specific minute or not.
